<p>* The special features I've created in this assignment is by using an html+css format which allows me to build an interactive website. 
     I've also created three php files which allow the user to enter their search result. Secondly, in the status code, I've created two input functions which help the user to comments status code. One required function begins with the capital S, it gives user hint to begin unique code number with capital S.
     Another function is to ensure that user only able to input 4 numeric characters in the status code.

<p>Which parts did you have trouble with?<br>
   * The most difficult part of the assignment was creating two searching data files and connects to the database. 
     In my opinion, this was the vital part of the assignment that can display the post and search information.
     Literally, it took me few days to figure out on connecting a file to the database. However, it still needs more improvement. </p>

<p>What would you like to do better next time?<br>
   * Next time I would do better by taking online courses and watch videos for my knowledge. </p>

<p>What references/sources you have used to help you learn how to create your website?<br>
